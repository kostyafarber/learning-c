/*
* Implement realpath()
*
*   The realpath utility uses the realpath(3) function to resolve all symbolic links, extra ‘/’ characters and references to /./ and /../ in path.  If path is absent, the current working
*   directory (‘.’) is assumed.
*
*   If -q is specified, warnings will not be printed when realpath(3) fails.
